# Introduction: 
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke. Some examples of CVDs include Arrhythmia, Myocardial Infarction, Coronary artery disease, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Pulmonary Embolism. 
# Question/Need:
It is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin. Therefore, this project aims to build a CNN model to aid doctors in diagnosing CVDs and eliminate human error by classifying ECG images of patients and ruling out possible diseases.

# Data Description:
The dataset consists of ECG images collected from 1687 distinct subjects of which some have Arrhythmia (548 patients), Myocardial Infarction (MI) (77 subjects), Previous History of MI (203 subjects), and a healthy control group (859 subjects).

# Tools:
Keras, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, Convolutional, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
